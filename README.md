# Yii App TestRunner

Yii App TestRunner is a [yii-framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/) based command for running test cases.
It can run [phpunit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/), [LiveTest](https://github.com/phphatesme/LiveTest) and selenium tests.
Currently thinking about including [atoum](https://github.com/mageekguy/atoum).
